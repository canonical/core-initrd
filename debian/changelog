    libnss-resolve was previously explicitly excluded from ubuntu-minimal,

    libnss-myhostname too, because it is in universe and there is no real
    need for systemd-resolved to Recommends: it.

  * debian/systemd-resolved.postinst: copy existing /etc/resolv.conf on new installs (LP: #1988772)
    Commit 20bc8a37fa ("Always setup /etc/resolv.conf on new installations.")
    added logic to copy any existing /etc/resolv.conf to
    /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf before creating the final symlink.
    When we merged the systemd-resolved package split changes from Debian,
    this logic was not replicated, which has caused regressions.
    Move the necessary pieces from systemd.postint to systemd-resolved.postinst
    to maintain the previous /etc/resolv.conf logic.

    not seem appropriate to carry this patch in Ubuntu.

  * Drop -Dtpm-pcrindex build option.
    Support for this was dropped in faacf1807e8fcbee4bf60495e0145e4522d76393.
    However, following discussion in [1], upstream changed the hardcoded PCR
    index for kernel command line measurement from 8 to 12 in
    4d32507f5186a89e98093659fbbe386787a97b9f. Thus, there is no functional
    change here.

  * New upstream version 249.6

  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.0
  * Drop obsolete C/R upstart from systemd-sysv
  * Drop obsolete dpkg (>= 1.19.3) | systemd-sysv dependency from udev.
    It was added to ensure we have a dpkg with --notify-await which is now
    satisfied by a dpkg from oldstable.
  * Make the C/R against systemd versioned in
    systemd-standalone-{sysusers,tmpfiles}
    Those were added to facilitate an upgrade from bullseye. The version
    makes it more explicit.
  * Drop obsolete migration code for RAMTMP, TPMTIME and UTC

  * Drop units-Don-t-start-systemd-udev-trigger.service-in-a-conta.patch
    we do run udevd in our containers and actually rely on udevadm trigger
    happening on boot for the udev database to populate with the relevant
    network devices that are present in the container
    It was added when systemd upstream made udevadm trigger more picky
    (would fail when it used to succeed), but they now have failures from udevadm
    ignored in the upstream unit
    making this patch un-necessary and actually harmful to those running Ubuntu in

  * Drop patches which are no longer needed after bullseye
  * Stop setting up device symlinks for CD-RW/DVD drives.
    Those udev rules were a Debian specific workaround that were mainly
    added for compat with older software which wasn't able to automatically
    discover those types of devices. Those rules didn't provide
    stable/predictable names though, so remove them. (Closes: #991639)
  * autopkgtest: add systemd-timesyncd dependency to timedated test.
    We need systemd-timesyncd in the timedated test, not just an arbitrary
    provider of time-daemon.
  * autopkgtest: clean up dependencies of boot-smoke test.
    A lot of the dependencies are not needed but were originally added to
    avoid a testbed reset and make it possible to reuse the testbed of the
    upstream test. This turned out to be a maintenance problem and the
    dependencies were not updated accordingly. Instead of trying to keep the
    two tests in sync, trim down the boot-smoke dependencies to its bare
    minimum.

  * New upstream version 248.3
  * Rebase patches

  [ Dan Streetman ]
  * d/t: replace 'root-unittests' shell script with simple call to upstream script.
    The upstream test runner script is much better, as it only prints failing test
    output, and gives a summary of the test results at the end.

systemd (248.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * New upstream version 248.1
  * Rebase patches
  * d/e/checkout-upstream: switch to main branch
  * Update make-fbdev-blacklist to not blacklist hyperv_fb

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * systemd.install: catch all files installed in usr/bin and bin.
    At the moment, individual binaries are mentioned specifically in the
    install file.  When new binaries are added, manual work is needed to get
    them packaged, which affects the upstream autopkgtest-based CI.
    Change systemd.install to instead pick up everything from usr/bin and bin.
  * upstream suite: add build-dep on vim-tiny.
    Required by some of the images in the upstream test suite

  [ Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek ]
  * Let "upstream" test use upstream test runner

  [ Dan Streetman ]
  * Slight adjustments to previous patch for deny/black-list naming.
    Also add in two vars used by the integration runner script
  * d/t/upstream: use NO_BUILD=1.
    Also don't bother sed-modifying test-functions file, as the NO_BUILD
    changes remove the need for that.
  * d/t/control: install all binary packages for upstream test.
    With the change to just call the upstream script to run the integration
    tests, the packages to test need to be installed so the test-function
    script can list out the files each package contains, and copy those files
    into each nspawn and/or qemu testbed. Without all packages installed,
    some tests fail; specifically TEST-30 currently requires systemd-timesyncd
    which was not previously installed for the 'upstream' test suite.
    This changes the control file to just install all binary packages, using
    the '@' notation.
  * d/t/boot-smoke: update test to avoid false negatives

  [ Frantisek Sumsal ]
  * upstream-ci: fix test_no_failed() check.
    Without `--plain` `systemctl` prints a circle (●) in the first column
    for each failed service, which with the current code interferes with
    attempted journal listing for each such service.

  * debian/rules: Build support for flushing of the nscd caches
  * debian/rules: Build translations for debs but not for udebs
  * debian/rules: Build without TPM2 support.

  * Ship systemd-cryptenroll in systemd package
  * Update symbols file for libsystemd0
  * debian/tests/control: Upstream test depends on attr
  * debian/udev.postinst: Create the sgx system group.
    Intel SGX enclave device nodes are now owned by this group.
  * debian/rules: Don't ship README files in (/usr)/lib/*.d.
    README files are typically shipped in /usr/share/doc.
  * Revert "pager: stop disabling urlification under a pager"

    timedated test.
  * autopkgtest: Merge configuration of logind test with timedated and related
    tests.
    They share the same restrictions and merging them avoids a bit of
    duplication.
  * Revert "test: disable DnsmasqClientTest.test_resolved_etc_hosts in

    strictly necessary.
    To ensure that systemd-timesyncd is installed in a default installation
    created by d-i, bump its priority to standard. (Closes: #986651, #993947)

  [ Matthias Klumpp ]
  * Configure localed to run locale-gen to generate missing locale.
    This applies an (upstreamed) patch to permit systemd-localed to run
    locale-gen to generate missing locale when requested to switch the
    system locale.
    This makes localectl usable on Debian for changing locale without
    breaking system localization or even prevent certain applications from
    running at all after switching to a non-generated locale.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * systemctl: do not shutdown immediately on scheduled shutdown.
    When, for whatever reason, a scheduled shutdown fails to be set, systemd
    will proceed with immediate shutdown without allowing the user to react.
    This is counterintuitive because when a scheduled shutdown is issued,
    it means the user wants to shutdown at a specified time in the future,
    not immediately. (Closes: #931235)
  * test: disable DnsmasqClientTest.test_resolved_etc_hosts in
    networkd-test.py.
    This test appears to be flaky.

  * Move libraries and NSS modules from /lib to /usr/lib.
    Keep libpam_systemd.so installed in /lib, as PAM doesn't support

  * test: use modern qemu numa arguments
    This fixes TEST-36-NUMAPOLICY from the upstream autopkgtest when using
    qemu >= 5.2.
  * Increase timeout when running unit tests.
    The default timeout for individual unit tests is 30s. On slower
    architectures and environments like reproducible-builds, this sometimes
    is not enough.
    Instead of fine-tuning the timeout for each individual test, we instead
    increase the timeouts by a factor of 10.
  * init-functions, getty-static.service: Don't hard-code path to systemctl
    binary.
    This should simplify an eventual move of systemctl from /bin to
    /usr/bin.
  * getty-static.service: Skip if dbus-broker is installed.
    Check for the binary in /usr/bin as this makes it easier to move the
    service files from /lib/systemd to /usr/lib/systemd.

  * Drop non-functional DefaultTasksMax patch.
    This patch was supposed to remove the DefaultTasksMax limit, but lost

  * init-functions: update LSB hook to not use ignore-dependencies
    job-mode=ignore-dependencies, as currently used in the LSB hook during

  * Add versioned Breaks against resolvconf (<< 1.83~) to systemd.
    The PathExists= directive was changed in v246 to match the documented
    behaviour but now causes resolvconf-pull-resolved.service to be
    continuously triggered by resolvconf-pull-resolved.path.
    This requires a fix in the resolvconf package, see #968015.
    (Closes: #967906)
  * Keep journal files compatible with older versions.
    Disable the KEYED-HASH journal feature by default and keep LZ4 (instead
    of ZSTD) as default compression for new journal files. Otherwise journal
    files are incompatible and can't be read by older journalctl
    implementations.
    This patch can be dropped in bullseye+1, as journalctl from bullseye
    will then be able to read journal files with those features.

  * Merge to Ubuntu from Debian unstable
  - Dropped changes:
    * d/rules: in dh_auto_test, include meson param --print-errorlogs.

systemd (245.4-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop Conflicts: virtualbox-guest-utils from systemd-timesyncd.
    Otherwise this could lead to virtualbox-guest-utils being uninstalled on
    upgrades which is not intended. (Closes: #956436)
  * pid1: automatically generate systemd-remount-fs.service deps, plus enable
    systemd-pstore from sysinit.target
  * Fix systemd-pstore.service enablement symlink on upgrades.
    It is now started via sysinit.target. Also clean up the symlink on
    purge.

  * d/rules: in dh_auto_test, include meson param --print-errorlogs.
    Also, don't cat testlog.txt; it's noisy and not very helpful.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * pid1: by default make user units inherit their umask from the user manager
    (Closes: #945000)
  * user-util: rework how we validate user names.
    This reworks the user validation infrastructure. There are now two
    modes. In regular mode we are strict and test against a strict set of
    valid chars. And in "relaxed" mode we just filter out some really
    obvious, dangerous stuff. i.e. strict is whitelisting what is OK, but
    "relaxed" is blacklisting what is really not OK.
    The idea is that we use strict mode whenever we allocate a new user,
    while "relaxed" mode is used when we process users registered elsewhere.

  * d/rules: in dh_auto_test, include meson param --print-errorlogs.
    Also, don't cat testlog.txt; it's noisy and not very helpful.

  * Ship systemd-timesyncd in a separate package.
    The new systemd-timesyncd package conflicting with other NTP-related
    packages resolves the problems arising when running systemd-timesyncd
    and other NTP servers on the same system.

  * New upstream version 245.4
    - Allow names starting with a digit (Closes: #954174)
    - Recognize davfs as network file system (Closes: #954755)
  * Enable systemd-pstore.service by default on new installs and upgrades
    (Closes: #952767)
  * Revert "Enable seccomp support on riscv64"
    This requires further changes to the source code and a newer, not yet
    officially released, libseccomp. Since this complicates backports revert
    this change for the time being.

  [ Dan Streetman ]
  * d/t/logind: use grep -s when checking /sys/power/state.
    Some kernels in Ubuntu (e.g. linux-kvm) do not enable CONFIG_PM, which
    results in stderr output when the logind test tries to grep the power
    state file, causing the test to fail.  The test already handles skipping
    the test if suspend isn't supported, so just use -s to suppress grep
    from printing to stderr if the file doesn't exist.

systemd (245.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 245.2
  * Rebase patches
  * Enable seccomp support on riscv64 (Closes: #954077)
  * Drop migration code for the switch from DynamicUser=yes to no.
    This code is no longer needed as it only affected systems between 239-1
    and 239-5, i.e. it never affected a stable release.

 -- Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Mar 2020 23:32:08 +0100

systemd (245-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revert "job: Don't mark as redundant if deps are relevant"
    This change negatively affects plymouth which was no longer properly
    stopped after the system has completed booting. The running plymouth
    daemon can trigger a VT switch (to tty1). (Closes: #953670)

systemd (245-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Balint Reczey ]
  * New upstream version 245
  * Refresh patches
  * Update symbols

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Disable repart, userdb, homed, fdisk, pwquality, p11kit feature.
    Those are new features which drag in new dependencies and need further
    review first.
  * analyze: Fix table time output
  * execute: Fix migration from DynamicUser=yes to no
  * Drop manual clean up of /var/lib/private/systemd/timesync.
    This is now done properly by systemd itself when a service switches from
    DynamicUser=yes to no.

  * New upstream version 244.2
    - polkit: when authorizing via PolicyKit re-resolve callback/userdata
      instead of caching it (CVE-2020-1712, Closes: #950732)
  * Rebase patches
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.5.0

  [ Balint Reczey ]
  * Remove empty /var/log/journal/ on purge

systemd (244.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update documentation regarding network interface naming.
    Document that 73-usb-net-by-mac.link needs to be masked together with
    99-default.link if one wants to disable the systemd naming scheme and keep
    the kernel-provided names. (Closes: #946196)
  * Update debian/rules clean target to remove all Python bytecode
  * Update systemd package description.
    Recommend init=/lib/systemd/systemd instead of init=/bin/systemd.
    The latter is just a compat symlink which might go away eventually.
  * shared/dropin: fix assert for invalid drop-in.
    Fixes an assertion when running systemctl cat on inexistent
    unit templates. (Closes: #950489)
  * core: call dynamic_user_acquire() only when 'group' is non-null.
    Fixes an assertion in systemd which could happen if a unit is reloaded
    and the unit is in bad-setting state. (Closes: #950409)
  * Don't fail upgrade if /proc is not mounted.
    Applying ACLs on /var/log/journal via systemd-tmpfiles requires a
    mounted /proc. Skip this step if /proc is not available, e.g. in a
    chroot. (Closes: #950533)

  * Report status of libpam-systemd and libnss-systemd in systemd reportbug
    template.
    Since the libpam-systemd Recommends was moved from systemd to
    systemd-sysv we no longer get this information automatically, so request
    it explicitly.
  * Drop btrfs-progs Recommends from systemd-container.
    Upstream has dropped the logic of setting up /var/lib/machines as btrfs
    loopback mount so this Recommends is no longer necessary.
  * Fix processing of dpkg triggers in systemd.
    We need to use $@ instead of "$@" so we can iterate through the
    individual trigger names which are passed as a space separated list in
    the second argument.
  * Fix cleanup of timesyncd state directory
  * Enable persistent journal.
    Create /var/log/journal on upgrades and new installs. This enables
    persistent journal in auto mode. (Closes: #717388)

    Upstream point releases appear there.

  [ Helmut Grohne ]
  * Add basic support for the noinsttest build profile
  * Annotate dbus build dependency with <!noinsttest>
    The dbus library is needed for building tests. As such it must be
    present unless we disable both build time and installed tests.
    Previously, building with the nocheck profile worked, but it didn't
    reproduce a regular build.

  * config: tpm-pcrindex=12, on Ubuntu only.
    In Ubuntu, we are trying to integrate measured boot with either bootctl or
    grub, or sometimes both using chainloading. In those cases we may want to seal
    against grub's PCRs, bootctl stub PCRs, or both at the same time. To achieve
    that, we wouldn't like to decouple grub's & bootctl's PCR and make the latter
    one use PCR #12.

  * Add lintian override for udev.
    60-autosuspend-chromiumos.rules triggers a udev-rule-missing-subsystem
    warning. This is a false positive, as SUBSYSTEM is tested at the
    beginning of the rules file.
  * Add lintian override for systemd-container
    systemd-nspawn@.service triggers a
    systemd-service-file-refers-to-unusual-wantedby-target warning but
    nspawn containers are supposed to be started via machines.target.
  * Make it easier to override MAC based name policy for USB network adapters.
    Replace 73-usb-net-by-mac.rules with 73-usb-net-by-mac.link. The .link
    file provides the same functionality but makes it easier to set a custom
    name for USB network adapters via the systemd.link mechanism.

systemd (242-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Dan Streetman ]
  * d/t/control: upstream test requires qemu-system-ppc on ppc64el
  * d/t/control: install seabios for upstream test.
    Some archs (at least arm64) qemu implementation require the vga bios.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop unused lintian override
  * network: fix ListenPort= in [WireGuard] section (Closes: #936198)
  * d/e/r/73-usb-net-by-mac.rules: import net.ifnames only for network devices
    (Closes: #934589)
  * d/e/r/73-usb-net-by-mac.rules: skip if iface name was provided by
    user-space
  * Drop dbus activation stub service.
    Since dbus 1.11.0, a dbus-daemon that is run with --systemd-activation
    automatically assumes that o.fd.systemd1 is an activatable service.
    As a result, with a new enough dbus version,
    /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.systemd1.service and
    /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.systemd1.service
    become unnecessary and can be removed. (Closes: #914015)
  * Revert "core: check start limit on condition checks too"
    If a unit was referenced too often, it hit the restart limit and the
    unit was marked as failed. Fixes a regression introduced in v242.
    (Closes: #935829)

  [ Michael Prokop ]
  * README.Debian: document KillUserProcesses behavior in Debian

systemd (242-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Dan Streetman ]
  * d/rules: add CONFFGLAGS_UPSTREAM to dh_auto_configure -- params

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * core: never propagate reload failure to service result.
    Fixes a regression introduced in v239 where the main process of a
    service unit gets killed on reload if ExecReload fails. (Closes: #936032)
  * shared/seccomp: add sync_file_range2.
    Some architectures need the arguments to be reordered because of alignment
    issues. Otherwise, it's the same as sync_file_range.
    Fixes sync_file_range failures in nspawn containers on arm, ppc.
    (Closes: #935091)
  * bash-completion: don't sort syslog priorities.
    By default, the available completions are sorted alphabetically, which
    is counterproductive in case of syslog priorities. Override the default
    behavior using the `nosort` option. (Closes: #913222)
  * test-bpf: skip test when run inside containers

  * d/t/storage: increase wait for plaintext_dev from 5 to 30 seconds
  * d/t/storage: wait for service to start, only stop if active
  * d/t/storage: don't search for 'scsi_debug' in ask_password
  * d/t/storage: manage scsi_debug using add_hosts (Closes: #929728)
  * d/t/storage: use short timeout waiting for scsi_debug block dev to appear
  * d/t/storage: convert password agent into normal Thread
  * d/t/storage: fail if socket info not in ask_password contents

  * d/t/boot-smoke: call fail if pidof polkitd fails
  * d/t/boot-smoke: remove check for running jobs

systemd (242-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop dependency on lsb-base.
    It is only needed when booting with sysvinit and initscripts, but
    initscripts already Depends on lsb-base (see #864999).
  * Stop removing enablement symlinks in /etc/systemd/system.
    With v242 this is no longer necessary as `ninja install` will no longer
    create those symlinks.
  * Replace manual removal of halt-local.service with upstream patch

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * Build manpages in .deb variant.
    Upstream snapshots are switching to building manpages off by default.

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * Enable portabled and install related files in systemd-container.
    Keep disabled for the udeb profile. (Closes: #918606)

systemd (242-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 242
    - Change ownership/mode of the execution directories also for static users
      (Closes: #919231)
    - A new boolean sandboxing option RestrictSUIDSGID= has been added that is
      built on seccomp. When turned on, creation of SUID/SGID files is
      prohibited. The NoNewPrivileges= and the new RestrictSUIDSGID= options
      are now implied if DynamicUser= is turned on for a service.
      (Closes: #928102, CVE-2019-3843, CVE-2019-3844)
  * Drop Revert-udev-network-device-renaming-immediately-give.patch.
    This patch needs ongoing maintenance work to be adapted to new releases
    and fails to apply with v242. Instead of investing more time into it we
    are going to drop the patch as it was a hack anyway.
  * Rebase patches
  * Drop pre-stretch migration code
  * Drop /sbin/udevadm compat symlink (Closes: #852580)
  * socket-util: Make sure flush_accept() doesn't hang on unexpected
    EOPNOTSUPP
  * Enable regexp matching support in journalctl using pcre2 (Closes: #898892)
  * Switch from libidn to libidn2 (Closes: #928615)

  * Drop systemd-shim alternative from libpam-systemd.
    A fixed systemd-shim package which works with newer versions of systemd
    is unlikely to happen given that the systemd-shim package has been
    removed from the archive. Drop the alternative dependency from
    libpam-systemd accordingly.
  * Properly remove duplicate directories from systemd package.
    When removing duplicate directories from the systemd package, sort the
    list of directories in reverse order so we properly delete nested
    directories.

  * pam-systemd: Use secure_getenv() rather than getenv()
    Fixes a vulnerability in the systemd PAM module which insecurely uses
    the environment and lacks seat verification permitting spoofing an

  * Set UseDomains to true, by default, on Ubuntu.
    On Ubuntu, fallback DNS servers are disabled, therefore we do not leak queries
    to a preset 3rd party by default. In resolved, dnssec is also disabled by
    default, as too much of the internet is broken and using Ubuntu users to debug
    the internet is not very productive - most of the time the end-user cannot fix
    or know how to notify the site owners about the dnssec mistakes. Inherintally
    the DHCP acquired DNS servers are therefore trusted, and are free to spoof
    records. Not trusting DNS search domains, in such scenario, provides limited
    security or privacy benefits. From user point of view, this also appears to be
    a regression from previous Ubuntu releases which do trust DHCP acquired search
    domains by default.
    Therefore we are enabling UseDomains by default on Ubuntu.
    Users may override this setting in the .network files by specifying
    [DHCP|IPv6AcceptRA] UseDomains=no|route options.

  * Create /etc/resolv.conf at postinst, pointing at the stub resolver.
    The stub resolver file is dynamically managed by systemd-resolved. It points at

    correctly use the DHCP acquired search domains.

    pam_limits in Debian defaults to "set_all", i.e. for limits which are
    not explicitly configured in /etc/security/limits.conf, the value from
    PID 1 is taken, which means for login sessions, RLIMIT_NOFILE is set to
    the highest possible value instead of 512K. Not every software is able
    to deal with such an RLIMIT_NOFILE properly.
    While this is arguably a questionable default in Debian's pam_limit,
    work around this problem by not bumping fs.nr_open in PID 1.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * autopkgtest: Make AppArmor violator test work with merged-usr
  * Make /dev/kvm accessible to local users and group kvm.
    Re-add the uaccess tag to /dev/kvm to make it accessible to local
    users. Access is also granted via group kvm, so create that in
    udev.postinst. (Closes: #887852)
  * Move a few man pages from systemd to systemd-journal-remote.
    The systemd package shipped a few systemd-journal-remote and
    systemd-journal-upload related man pages which really belong into the
    systemd-journal-remote package. Move those man pages into the correct
    package and add a Breaks/Replaces against systemd accordingly.
    (Closes: #903557)
  * autopkgtest: Drop no-longer needed workaround from upstream test
  * Go back to statically allocate system users for timesyncd, networkd and
    resolved.
    There are currently too many open issues related to D-Bus and the usage
    of DynamicUser. (Closes: #902971)
  * Change python3-minimal dependency to python3.
    While we strictly only need python3-minimal, the usage of
    python3-minimal triggers a lintian error: depends-on-python-minimal
  * test: Drop SKIP_INITRD for QEMU-based tests.
    The Debian Linux kernel ships ext4 support as a module, so we require an
    initrd to successfully start the QEMU images.
  * debian/tests/localed-x11-keymap: Deal with absence of
    /etc/default/keyboard more gracefully
  * autopkgtest: Add various dependencies to make upstream test pass on Debian
    - netcat-openbsd: Required by TEST-12-ISSUE-3171.
    - busybox-static: Required by TEST-13-NSPAWN-SMOKE.
    - plymouth: Required by TEST-15-DROPIN and TEST-22-TMPFILES.
  * Drop seccomp system call filter for udev.
    The seccomp based system call whitelist requires at least systemd 239 to
    be the active init and during a dist-upgrade we can't guarantee that
    systemd has been fully configured before udev is restarted.
    The versioned systemd Breaks that was added to udev for #902185 didn't
    really fix this issue, so revert that change again. (Closes: #903224)

    The logind and timedated tests in python-dbusmock were broken by the

    See #902602
  * Drop patches which try to support running systemd services without systemd
    as pid 1.
    No one is currently actively maintaining systemd-shim, which means that
    e.g. running systemd-logind no longer works when systemd is not pid 1.

  * Drop alternative btrfs-tools Recommends.
    It is no longer needed as btrfs-progs is now available in both Debian

  * Drop fallback for older kernels when running the test suite.

  * Update symbols file for libsystemd0
  * Rebase patches
  * Install new resolvectl tool.
    Don't ship the /sbin/resolvconf compat symlink in the systemd package,

  * Disable support for "Portable Services"

  * Disable pristine-tar in gbp.conf.
    It is currently not possible to import the systemd v239 tarball using

    This is apparently a regression in Ubuntu 18.04, not in systemd, so
    ignore it.

  * sd-bus: Do not try to close already closed fd (Closes: #896781)
  * Use dh_missing to act on uninstalled files.
    The usage of dh_install --fail-missing has been deprecated.
  * meson: Avoid warning about comparison of bool and string.
    The result of this is undefined and will become a hard error in a future
    Meson release.
  * login: Respect --no-wall when cancelling a shutdown request
    (Closes: #897938)
  * Add dependencies of libsystemd-shared to Pre-Depends.
    This is necessary so systemctl is functional at all times during a
    dist-upgrade. (Closes: #897986)
  * Drop dh_strip override, the dbgsym migration is done

  * Don't include libmount.h in a header file.
    Kernel and glibc headers both use MS_* constants, but are not in sync, so
    only one of them can be used at a time. Thus, only import them where
    needed. Works around #898743.

  * Fix /sys/fs/cgroup mount when using SELinux.
    Since v236, all cgroups except /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd and
    /sys/fs/cgroup/unified are not mounted when SELinux is enabled (even in
    permissive mode). Disabling SELinux completely restores these cgroups.
    This patch fixes that issue by no longer making the assumption that those
    cgroups are mounted by initrd/dracut before systemd is started.

    systemd 238 now supports  specifying different uid and gid and a
    non-default login shell, so this is possible now. (Closes: #888126)
  * udev README.Debian: Include initrd rebuild and some clarifications in
    migration.
    While initrd update is already being mentioned in the introductory
    section, it is easy to miss when going through the migration steps, so
    explicitly mention it again. Also add a warning about keeping a fallback
    on misconfigurations, and the possibility to migrate one interface at a

  * Switch from XC-Package-Type to Package-Type. As of dpkg-dev 1.15.7
    Package-Type is recognized as an official field name.

  * Backport upstream (partial) fix for combined DynamicUser= + User=
    UID was not allowed to be different to GID, which is normally the case in
    debian, due to the group users being allocated the GID 100 without an
    equivalent UID 100 being allocated.
  * Backport upstream patches to fully make DynamicUser=yes + static,
    pre-existing User= work.

  * Add missing python3-minimal dependency to systemd-tests
  * Drop long-obsolete systemd-bus-proxy system user
    systemd-bus-proxy hasn't been shipped since before stretch and never
    created any files. Thus clean up the obsolete system user on upgrades.
    (Closes: #878182)
  * Drop static systemd-journal-gateway system user
    systemd-journal-gatewayd.service now uses DynamicUser=, so we don't need
    to create this statically any more. Don't remove the user on upgrades
    though, as there is likely still be a running process. (Closes: #878183)
  * Use DynamicUser= for systemd-journal-upload.service.
  * Add Recommends: libnss-systemd to systemd-sysv.
    This is useful to actually be able to resolve dynamically created system
    users with DynamicUser=true. This concept is going to be used much more
    in future versions and (hopefully) third-party .services, so pulling it
    into the default installation seems prudent now.

    This should resolve ADT test failures, on arm64, when running as root.
  * Disable KillUserProcesses, yet again, with meson this time.
  * initramfs-tools: trigger udevadm add actions with subsystems first.
    This updates the initramfs-tools init-top udev script to trigger udevadm
    actions with type specified. This mimics the systemd-udev-trigger.service.
    Without type specified only devices are triggered, but triggering

  * ubuntu: udev.postinst preserve virtio interfaces names on upgrades, on s390x.
    New udev generates stable interface names on s390x kvm instances, however, upon
    upgrades existing ethX names should be preserved to prevent breaking networking
    and software configurations.
    This patch only affects Ubuntu systems. (Closes: #860246) (LP: #1682437)
  * Set UseDomains to true, by default, on Ubuntu.
    On Ubuntu, fallback DNS servers are disabled, therefore we do not leak queries
    to a preset 3rd party by default. In resolved, dnssec is also disabled by
    default, as too much of the internet is broken and using Ubuntu users to debug
    the internet is not very productive - most of the time the end-user cannot fix
    or know how to notify the site owners about the dnssec mistakes. Inherintally
    the DHCP acquired DNS servers are therefore trusted, and are free to spoof
    records. Not trusting DNS search domains, in such scenario, provides limited
    security or privacy benefits. From user point of view, this also appears to be
    a regression from previous Ubuntu releases which do trust DHCP acquired search
    domains by default.
    Therefore we are enabling UseDomains by default on Ubuntu.
    Users may override this setting in the .network files by specifying
    [DHCP|IPv6AcceptRA] UseDomains=no|route options.
  * resolved: create private stub resolve file for integration with resolvconf.
    The stub-resolve.conf file points at resolved stub resolver, but also lists the
    available search domains. This is required to correctly resolve domains without
    using resolve nss module.
  * Enable systemd-resolved by default
  * Create /etc/resolv.conf at postinst, pointing at the stub resolver.
    The stub resolver file is dynamically managed by systemd-resolved. It points at
    the stub resolver as the nameserver, however it also dynamically updates the
    search stanza, thus non-nss dns tools work correctly with unqualified names and
    correctly use the DHCP acquired search domains.
  * libnss-resolve: do not disable and stop systemd-resolved
    resolved is always used by default on ubuntu via stub resolver, therefore it
    should continue to operate without libnss-resolve module installed.
  * modprobe.d: set max_bonds=0 for bonding module to prevent bond0 creation.
    This prevents confusing networkd, and allows networkd to manage bond0.
  * Cherrypick upstream networkd-test.py assertion/check fixes.

  Merge from experimental. Existing Ubuntu cherry-picks:
  * TEST-12: cherry-pick upstream fix for compat with new netcat-openbsd.
  * networkd: cherry-pick support for setting bridge port's priority.
    This is a useful feature/bugfix to improve feature parity of networkd with
    ifupdown. This matches netplan's expectations to be able to set bridge port's
    priorities via networked. This featue is to be used by netplan/MAAS/OpenStack.
  * Cherrypick upstream commit to enable system use kernel maximum limit for RLIMIT_NOFILE isntead of hard-coded (low) limit of 65536.
  * debian/tests/root-unittests: disable execute and seccomp tests on arm
    test-seccomp and test-execute fail on arm64 kernels. Marking both tests as
    expected failures. An upstream bug report is filed to resolve these.
  * Cherrypick upstream patch for vio predictable interface names.
  * Cherrypick upstream patch for platform predictable interface names.

  Ubuntu cherry-picks, now also applied in Debian:
  * resolved: fix null pointer dereference crash

  Remaining Ubuntu delta:
  * ubuntu: udev.postinst preserve virtio interfaces names on upgrades, on s390x.
    New udev generates stable interface names on s390x kvm instances, however, upon
    upgrades existing ethX names should be preserved to prevent breaking networking
    and software configurations.
    This patch only affects Ubuntu systems.
  * Skip starting systemd-remount-fs.service in containers
    even when /etc/fstab is present.
    This allows entering fully running state even when /etc/fstab
    lists / to be mounted from a device which is not present in the
    container.

  * loginctl: Chrerry-pick upstream fix to not ignore multiple session ids.

    package. This is safe, as hal is long dead and no longer useful.
  * Drop systemd-ui Suggests
    systemd-ui is unmaintained upstream and not particularly useful anymore.
  * journal: fix up syslog facility when forwarding native messages.
    Native journal messages (_TRANSPORT=journal) typically don't have a

    This helps plymouth to detect applicable devices. (Closes: #756109)
  * networkd: Fix crash when setting routes.
  * resolved: Drop removal of resolvconf entry on stop.
    This leads to timeouts on shutdown via the resolvconf hooks and does not
    actually help much -- /etc/resolv.conf would then just be empty instead of
    having a nonexisting 127.0.0.53 nameserver, so manually stopping resolved
    in a running system is broken either way. (LP: #1648068)
  * Keep RestrictAddressFamilies on amd64.
    This option and libseccomp currently work on amd64 at least, so let's make
    sure it does not break there as well, and benefit from the additional
    protection at least on this architecture.
  * Explicitly set D-Bus policy dir.
    This is about to change upstream in

  * debian/tests/unit-config: Query pkg-config for system unit dir.
    This fixes confusion on merged-/usr systems where both /usr/lib/systemd and
    /lib/systemd exist. It's actually useful to verify that systemd.pc says the
    truth.
  * debian/tests/upstream: Fix clobbering of merged-/usr symlinks
  * debian/tests/systemd-fsckd: Create /etc/default/grub.d if necessary
  * debian/rules: Drop check for linking to libs in /usr.
    This was just an approximation, as booting without an initrd could still be
    broken by library updates (e. g. #828991). With merged /usr now being the
    default this is now completely moot.
  * Move kernel-install initrd script to a later prefix.
    60- does not leave much room for scripts that want to run before initrd
    building (which is usually one of the latest things to do), so bump to 85.
    Thanks to Sjoerd Simons for the suggestion.
  * Disable 99-default.link instead of the udev rule for disabling persistent
    interface names.
    Disabling 80-net-setup-link.rules will also cause ID_NET_DRIVER to not be
    set any more, which breaks 80-container-ve.network and matching on driver
    name in general. So disable the actual default link policy instead. Still
    keep testing for 80-net-setup-link.rules in the upgrade fix and
    73-usb-net-by-mac.rules to keep the desired behaviour on systems which

    dpkg-shlibdeps fails to find libsystemd-shared as we no longer create a
    shlibs file for it.
  * Add Build-Depends-Package to libudev1.symbols and libsystemd0.symbols.
    This ensures proper dependencies when a package has a Build-Depends on a
    higher version of libudev-dev or libsystemd-dev then what it gets from the
    used symbols.

  * debian/tests/upstream: Clean up old journals before running a test, to

    seems to have been fixed now.

  * Add debian/extra/units/systemd-resolved.service.d/resolvconf.conf to tell
    resolvconf about resolved's builtin DNS server on 127.0.0.53. With that,
    DNS servers picked up via networkd are respected when using resolvconf,

  * Drop halt-local.service. This has never been documented/used in Debian.

  * debian/extra/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/udev: Prefer "nuke"
    again, it comes from klibc-utils. But fall back to "rm" if it does not
    exist.
  * systemd-timesyncd.service.d/disable-with-time-daemon.conf: Also don't run
    if /usr/sbin/VBoxService exists, as virtualbox-guest-utils already
    provides time synchronization with the host. (Closes: #812522)
  * Drop Michael Stapelberg from Uploaders:, he stopped maintenance long ago.
    Thanks Michael for your great work in the past!
  * Replace "sysv-rc" dependency with Conflicts: openrc, file-rc. The
    rationale from #739679 still applies, but with the moving of
    {invoke,update}-rc.d to init-system-helpers we don't actually need
    anything from sysv-rc any more other than the assumption that SysV init
    scripts are enabled in /etc/rc?.d/ for the SysV generator to work (and
    file-rc and openrc don't do that).
  * debian/tests/timedated: Verify /etc/localtime symlink. Skip verifying the
    /etc/timezone file (which is Debian specific) if $TEST_UPSTREAM is set.

    set.
  * debian/tests/localed-x11-keymap: Test /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf
    if $TEST_UPSTREAM is set.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Check for reaching graphical.target
    instead of default.target, as the latter is a session systemd state only.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Skip tests which are known to fail/not
    applicable with testing upstream builds.
  * Drop Fix-up-tmpfiles.d-permissions-properly.patch:
    - /run/lock is already created differently by
      Make-run-lock-tmpfs-an-API-fs.patch, and contradicts to that.
    - /run/lock/lockdev/ isn't being used anywhere and got dropped
      upstream; backport the patch (tmpfiles-drop-run-lock-lockdev.patch).
    - Move dropping of "group:wheel" (which has never existed in Debian) into
      debian/rules, to also catch occurrences in other parts of the file which
      the static patch would overlook.
  * Shorten persistent identifier for CCW network interfaces (on s390x only).
    (LP: #1526808)
  * debian/rules: If $TEST_UPSTREAM is set (when building/testing upstream
    master instead of distro packages), don't fail on non-installed new files
    or new library symbols.
  * Add systemd-sysv conflict to upstart-sysv, and version the upstart
    conflict. This works with both Debian's and Ubuntu's upstart packages.

  * Drop support for the /etc/udev/disabled flag file. This was a workaround
    for udev failing to install with debootstrap because it didn't use
    invoke-rc.d and therefor was not compliant with policy-rc.d. See #520742
    for further details. This is no longer the case, so supporting that file
    only leads to confusion about its purpose.
  * Retrigger cleanup of org.freedesktop.machine1.conf and
    hwclock-save.service now that dpkg has been fixed to correctly pass the
    old version to postinst on upgrade. (Closes: #802545)
  * Only ship *.link files as part of the udev package. The *.network files
    are solely used by systemd-networkd and should therefor be shipped by the
    systemd package. (Closes: #808237)
  * Cherry-pick a few fixes from upstream:
    - Fix unaligned access in initialize_srand(). (Closes: #812928)
    - Don't run kmod-static-nodes.service if module list is empty. This
      requires kmod v23. (Closes: #810367)
    - Fix typo in systemctl(1). (Closes: #807462)
    - Fix systemd-nspawn --link-journal=host to not fail if the directory
      already exists. (Closes: #808222)
    - Fix a typo in logind-dbus.c. The polkit action is named
      org.freedesktop.login1.power-off, not org.freedesktop.login1.poweroff.
    - Don't log an EIO error in gpt-auto-generator if blkid finds something
      which is not a partition table. (Closes: #765586)
    - Apply ACLs to /var/log/journal and also set them explicitly for
      system.journal.
  * Only skip the filesystem check for /usr if the /run/initramfs/fsck-usr
    flag file exists. Otherwise we break booting with dracut which uses
    systemd inside the initramfs. (Closes: #810748)
  * Update the instructions in README.Debian for creating /var/log/journal.
    They are now in line with the documentation in the systemd-journald(8) man
    page and ensure that ACLs and group permissions are properly set.
    (Closes: #800947, #805617)

    longer necessary as invoke-rc.d and init-system-helpers take care of this

    older than 3.13 and ignore test failures for those.
  * debian/tests/networkd: Factor out dnsmasq specific test "router" setup, so
    that we can test against other implementations.
  * debian/tests/networkd: Add router setup using an (isolated) networkd
    process for configuring the veths and DHCP server.
  * debian/tests/networkd: On failure, only show journal for current test.
  * systemd-networkd-resolvconf-update.service: Wait for getting a name
    server, not just for getting online.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Wait until bash crash stack trace is in

    architectures.
  * debian/tests/networkd: If /etc/resolv.conf already has three nameservers,

  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Don't check for "Requesting system
    poweroff" log message in nspawn test, current upstream master does not
    write that any more. Instead check for "Stopped Container c1".
  * Add "storage" autopkgtest. Initially this covers some basic use cases with

  * Add acl build dependency (for <!nocheck>). Current upstream master now
    needs it for some test cases.
  * debian/extra/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/udev: Use "rm -rf"
    instead of "nuke". The latter does not exist any more in current

  * Ignore test failures during "make check" if /etc/machine-id is missing
    (like in ancient local schroots). (Closes: #807884)
  * debian/extra/rules/80-debian-compat.rules: Remember which device got the
    "cdrw", "dvd", or "dvdrw" symlink to avoid changing links on device
    events. (Closes: #774080). Drop the rule for the "cdrom" symlink as that
    is already created in 60-cdrom_id.rules.
  * Eliminate "hotplug.functions" udev helper and put the logging functions
    directly into net.agent. This simplifies the migration of the latter to
    ifupdown.
  * Adjust manpages to keep /usr/lib/systemd/{user*,boot,ntp-units.d,modules*}
    paths, only keep /lib/systemd/{system*,network}. (Closes: #808997)
  * debian/udev.README.Debian: Fix typo and slight wording improvement.

  * Drop net.agent, 80-networking.rules, and ifup@.service. These moved to
    ifupdown 0.8.5 now. Add Breaks: to earlier versions.

    that swap devices are being stopped prematurely during shutdown.
    (Closes: #805133)
  * Drop unneeded /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/50-systemd-user.sh from the package
    and clean up the conffile on upgrades. We have the dbus-user-session
    package in Debian to properly enable the D-Bus user-session mode which

  * Make networkd call if-up.d/ scripts when it brings up interfaces, to
    become compatible with ifupdown and NetworkManager for packages shipping
    hooks. (LP: #1492129)
    - Add debian/extra/systemd-networkd-dispatcher.c: suid root wrapper for
      calling if-up.d/ or if-post-down.d/ hook scripts. Install it as
      root:systemd-networkd 4754 so that only networkd can run it.
    - Add networkd-call-systemd-networkd-dispatcher-when-links.patch: Call the
      above wrapper when links go up/down.
    - debian/tests/networkd: Verify that if-up.d/ and if-post-down.d/ scripts
      get run for a networkd managed interface.
    - Note that if-pre-up.d/ and if-down.d/ scripts are *not* being called, as
      they are often not applicable for networkd (if-pre-up.d) and unreliable
      (if-down.d).
  * Drop udev-finish. We needed this for the autogenerated CD and network

  * Drop debian/udev.udev-fallback-graphics.upstart. The vesafb module has

  * debian/README.Debian: As systemd is the default init now, replace the

    - Fixes machined state tracking logic. (Closes: #788269)
  * Add better fix for "systemctl link/enable" breakage with full paths.
    (LP: #1480310)
  * debian/rules: Add missing $(dh_options) in overridden debhelper targets.

  [ Felipe Sateler ]
  * Move conffile from systemd to systemd-container package (Closes: #797048)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop unnecessary Conflicts/Replaces from systemd-journal-remote.
    None of the files in this package were previously shipped by systemd.
  * Create system users for systemd-journal-{gateway,remote,upload} when
    installing the systemd-journal-remote package.
  * Explicitly turn off the features we don't want in a stage1 build.
    Otherwise ./configure might enable them automatically if the build
    dependencies are installed and "dh_install --fail-missing" will then fail
    due to uninstalled files.
  * Enable GnuTLS support as systemd-journal-remote makes sense mostly with
    encryption enabled.
  * Rely on build profiles to determine which packages should be skipped
    during build and no longer specify that manually.
  * Drop our patch which removes rc-local-generator.
    rc-local.service acts as an ordering barrier even if its condition is
    false, because conditions are evaluated when the service is about to be
    started, not when it is enqueued. We don't want this ordering barrier on
    systems that don't need/use /etc/rc.local.

    rename to 40-vm-hotadd.rules.
  * Fix networkd crash. (Closes: #796358)
  * debian/rules: Remove all files/empty dirs in systemd which are already

  * Bump "mount" dependency to >= 2.26, to ensure "swapon -o" availability.
    (Closes: #796389)
  * Install /lib/systemd/network/* into udev instead of systemd, as it's
    really udev which is evaluating these.

  * Move transitional libgcrypt11-dev build dep to libgcrypt20-dev.
  * debian/rules: Limit check for libraries in /usr to systemd and udev

  * networkd autopkgtest: More robust/forceful killing of dnsmasq.
  * ifup@.service: Drop "oneshot" to run ifup in the background during boot.
    This avoids blocking network.target on boot with unavailable hotplug

    - Document removal of PIDFile on daemon shutdown. (Closes: #734006)
    - Drop Revert-rules-fix-tests-for-removable-state.patch, the auto-suspend
      rules now got dropped entirely.
  * Add Revert-VT-reuse-patches.patch: Revert a couple of logind VT reuse
    patches which alternately broke lightdm and gdm.
  * debian/libsystemd0.symbols: Add new symbols from this release.
  * Disable test-netlink during package build, fails on some buildds.
  * udev.postinst: Don't call addgroup with --quiet, so that if the "input"
    group already exists as a non-system group you get a sensible error
    message. Some broken tutorials forget the --system option.
    (Closes: #769948, LP: #1455956)
  * systemd.postinst: Drop the --quiet from the addgroup calls as well, same
    reason as above. (Closes: #762275)
  * udev: Drop doc dir symlinking. It has caused too much trouble and only
    marginally helps to avoid duplication. Such duplication should be dealt
    with at the distro, not package level.
  * debian/rules: Entirely ignore $LD_PRELOAD instead of just libfakeroot in
    the link check, to also avoid libeatmydata. (Closes: #790546)
  * boot-and-services, display-managers autopkgtests: Install and configure
    dummy X.org driver, so that these work in headless machines/VMs.
  * systemd-fsckd autopkgtest: Stop using/asserting on lightdm, just check
    that default.target is active. lightdm is prone to fail in test
    environments, and fiddling with it in two other autopkgtests is
    sufficient.
  * debian/watch: Adjust to new upstream release model of only providing the
    github tag tarballs.
  * Drop dsl-modem.agent. It hasn't been maintained/tested for many years, few
    if any people actually use this, and this doesn't belong into udev.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Stop building the Python 3 bindings. They were split into a separate

  * Remove obsolete --disable-chkconfig configure option.
  * Move the man pages for libnss-myhostname, libnss-mymachines and udev.conf
    from systemd into the correct package. Move the zsh completion file for
    udevadm into the udev package as well. Add Breaks/Replaces accordingly.
    (Closes: #790879)

  * initramfs hook: Stop installing 55-dm.rules, 64-md-raid.rules,
    60-persistent-storage-lvm.rules and 60-persistent-storage-dm.rules.
    The mdadm, lvm2 and dmsetup package provide their own udev hooks nowadays
    to make sure their udev rules files are installed into the initramfs.
    Having the copy rules at two places is confusing and makes debugging
    harder.
  * Make it possible to skip building udeb packages via
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="noudeb". This allows quicker builds for local testing
    and is benefical for derivatives that don't use d-i.
  * Install API documentation for libudev and libsystemd in their respective
    packages. Both libraries use man pages now, so we need to be explicit
    about what is installed where.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * ifupdown-hotplug autopkgtest: Different cloud/desktop environments have
    different ways of including /etc/network/interfaces.d/, try to get along
    wit either and skip the test if interfaces.d/ does not get included at
    all.
  * Drop obsolete gtk-doc-tools build dependency, gtkdocize autoreconfig, and
    ./configure options.
  * libudev-dev.install: Drop gtk-doc files, not built by upstream any more
    and replaced with manpages.
  * libsystemd0.symbols: Add new symbols for this release.
  * debian/rules: Fix paths in manpages as we don't currently have a merged
    /usr in Debian but have most systemd things in /lib. This replaces the
    previous huge and maintenance-intense patch.
  * Drop Accept-mountall-specific-fstab-options.patch. Replaced with
    systemd.postinst migration code in Ubuntu.
  * Revert overly aggressive USB autosuspend udev rules change which broke
    various USB keyboards. (Closes: #789723)
  * Have rc-local.service output also go to the console. /etc/rc.local often
    contains status messages which users expect to see during boot.
    (LP: #1468102)
  * debian/rules: Install udev.NEWS into libudev1, to get along with Debian's
    udev -> libudev1 doc dir symlinking. (Closes: #790042)

      net.ifnames by default.
    - Revert-udev-network-device-renaming-immediately-give.patch: Adjust
      patch comment.
    - Drop 75-persistent-net-generator.rules, write_net_rules helper and
      rule_generator.functions.
    - Adjust udev's README.Debian accordingly, and describe the migration.
      This needs to happen manually as there is no robust way of doing this
      automatically.
    - Add udev NEWS file for announcing this change and pointing to udev's
      README.
    - udev.postinst: Drop write_interfaces_rules().
    - udev.postinst: Disable net.ifnames on systems which did not support
      75-persistent-net-generator.rules (most importantly, virtualized guests)
      to avoid changing network interface names on upgrade.
    - LP: #1454254
  * fsckd-daemon-for-inter-fsckd-communication.patch: Add fsckd.c to
    POTFILES.in.
  * ifupdown-hotplug autopkgtest: Fix config name in interfaces.d/, it must
    not have a suffix in Debian. Also clean up the file after the test.
  * net.agent: When running under systemd, run everything in the foreground.
    This avoids killing the forked child in the middle of its operation under
    systemd when the parent exits.
  * Check during build that systemd and systemd-journald don't link against
    anything in /usr, to prevent bugs like #771652 and #788913 in the future.
  * Drop Skip-99-systemd.rules-when-not-running-systemd-as-in.patch. The rules
    mostly just attach tags systemd specific properties which are harmless
    under other init systems, and systemd-sysctl also works there.
  * 80-networking.rules: Only call agents for add|remove, as they don't handle
    other events.
  * Restore udev watches on block device changes. (Closes: #789060,

    - systemd.postinst: When tmp.mount already was enabled, install tmp.mount
      into /etc and keep it enabled.

    This does not concern udev in particular, but is handled by
    initramfs-tools itself (scripts/local). The intention of this parameter is
    not to statically wait for the given time, but wait *up to* that time for
    the root device to appear.
  * Add debian/extra/units/rc-local.service.d/wait-online.conf: Make
    rc-local.service wait for network-online.target (if it gets started). This
    not specified by LSB, but has been behaving that way in Debian under SysV
    init and upstart. (LP: #1451797)
  * Fix parsing of escape characters in Exec*= lines. (Closes: #787256)
  * Drop path_is_mount_point-handle-false-positive-on-some-fs.patch (it was
    already not applied in 220-1). This needs to be re-thought and re-done
    against the current code, and overlayfs in general. On overlayfs this
    still reports false positives for files that changed in the upperdir, but
    this does not break systemd-machine-id-commit any more.
  * Add debian/extra/rules/80-debian-compat.rules, replacing three of our

  * Cherry-pick patch to fix udevd --daemon assertion regression.
  * Cherry-pick patch to fix udevd worker hang.
  * systemd.install: systemd.pc moved back into /usr/share/pkgconfig/.
  * libsystemd0.symbols: Add new symbols from this release.
  * Drop debian/extra/60-keyboard.hwdb for now. Upstream has a newer version,
    and it's not nearly as often updated any more as it used to be.
  * debian/rules: Remove shipped audit_type-to-name.h and
    keyboard-keys-from-name.gperf and regenerate them during build (bug in
    upstream 220 tarball).
  * autopkgtest: Ship/use mock fsck from debian/tests, as it's missing in the
    220 tarball.
  * Add libnss-mymachines binary package. (Closes: #784858)
  * Add libnss-myhostname binary package, taking over from the very old and
    unmaintained standalone source package as per its maintainer's request.
    (Closes: #760514)
  * Drop buildsys-Don-t-default-to-gold-as-the-linker.patch and set LD in
    debian/rules on sparc only. This can be dropped entirely once we build
    GUdev from a separate source.
  * bootchart autopkgtest: Skip test if /proc/schedstat does not exist, i. e.
    the kernel is missing CONFIG_SCHEDSTAT. Bootchart requires this.
  * systemd-fsckd autopkgtest: On Debian plymouth-start stays running, adjust
    was_running() for that.
  * systemd-fsckd autopkgtest: In test_systemd_fsck_with_plymouth_failure(),
    fix plymouthd status check to work under both Debian and Ubuntu.
  * Replace almost all of Fix-paths-in-man-pages.patch with upstreamed
    patches. (The remainder is planned to get fixed upstream as well.)
  * Remove our update-rc.d patches, replace them with upstream patches for
    /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install abstraction, and provide one for
    update-rc.d. Also implement "is-enabled" command by directly checking for

  * Remove /var/run and /var/lock migration code from debian-fixup. The /run
    migration was completed in wheezy so this is no longer necessary.
  * Drop our versioned Depends on initscripts. This was initially added for
    the /run migration and later to ensure we have a mountnfs hook which
    doesn't cause a deadlock under systemd. The /run migration was completed
    in wheezy and jessie ships a fixed mountnfs hook. In addition we now use
    the ignore-dependencies job mode in our lsb init-functions hook, so it's
    safe to drop this dependency.
  * Stop building gudev packages. Upstream has moved the gudev code into a
    separate repository which is now managed on gnome.org. The gudev packages
    will be built from src:libgudev from now on. See also

    upstream fix which is more general.

  * Make no-patch-numbers the default for gbp-pq.
  * Cherry-pick upstream fix to properly handle multiline syslog messages.
    (Closes: #746351)
  * Cherry-pick upstream fix for libudev which fixes a memleak in
    parent_add_child().
  * Drop "-b debian" from Vcs-Git since we use the master branch for
    packaging now.
  * Drop Conflicts: sysvinit (<< 2.88dsf-44~) from systemd-sysv since this
    breaks dist-upgrades from wheezy when switching from sysvinit to
    systemd-sysv as default init. While downgrading the Pre-Depends in
    sysvinit would have been an alternative, dropping the Conflicts and only
    keeping the Replaces was deemed the lesser evil. (Closes: #748355)
  * Use Conflicts instead of Breaks against sysvinit-core. This avoids
    /sbin/init going missing when switching from systemd-sysv to sysvinit.
    While at it, add a Replaces: upstart. (Closes: #751589)
  * Make the SysV compat tools try both /run/initctl and /dev/initctl. This
    makes them usable under sysvinit as PID 1 without requiring any symlinks.
  * Various ifupdown integration fixes
    - Use DefaultDependencies=no in ifup@.service so the service can be
      started as early as possible.
    - Create the ifupdown runtime directory in ifup@.service as we can no
      longer rely on the networking service to do that for us.
    - Don't stop ifup@.service on shutdown but let the networking service take
      care of stopping all hotplugged interfaces.
    - Only start ifup@.service for interfaces configured as allow-hotplug.

  * The hwdb builtin has replaced pci-db and usb-db in udev. Drop the

  * Add Depends on libpam-runtime (>= 1.0.1-6) to libpam-systemd as we are
    using pam-auth-update.
  * Explicitly set Section and Priority for the udev binary package.
  * Update Build-Depends:

    - Add gtk-doc-tools and libglib2.0-doc for the API documentation in
      libudev and libgudev.
    - Add libgirepository1.0-dev and gobject-introspection for GObject
      introspection support in libgudev.
    - Add libgcrypt11-dev for encryption support in the journal.
    - Add libblkid-dev for the blkid udev builtin.
  * Use gir dh addon to ensure ${gir:Depends} is properly set.
  * Rename libudev0 → libudev1 for the SONAME bump.
  * Update symbols files. libudev now uses symbols versioning as the other
    libsystemd libraries. The libgudev-1.0-0 symbols file has been copied from
    the old udev package.
  * Run gtkdocize on autoreconf.
  * Enable python bindings for the systemd libraries and ship them in a new
    package named python-systemd.
  * Tighten Depends on libsystemd-id128-dev for libsystemd-journal-dev as per

  * Remove obsolete bash-completion scripts on upgrades. Nowadays they are
    installed in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.
  * Rename conffiles for logind and journald.
  * Rename udev-gtk-udeb → libudev1-udeb to better reflect its actual contents.
  * Build two flavours: a regular build and one for the udev udebs with
    reduced features/dependencies.
  * Create a few compat symlinks for the udev package, most notably
    /sbin/udevadm and /sbin/udevd.
  * Remove the dpkg-triggered debian-enable-units script. This was a temporary
    workaround for wheezy. Packages should use dh-systemd now to properly
    integrate service files with systemd.

  * Keep the old persistent network interface naming scheme for now and make
    the new one opt-in via net.ifnames=1 on the kernel command line.
