Subject: network: add link->setting_genmode flag

Similar to the link->setting_mtu flag, this delays continued configuration
until after the genmode has been successfully set; this is important
because we do not want networkd to raise the interface before the genmode
has been set, as if we're disabling the genmode, raising the interface
before we have successfully disabled the genmode will result in the kernel
creating a ipv6ll address, even though we don't want that.
