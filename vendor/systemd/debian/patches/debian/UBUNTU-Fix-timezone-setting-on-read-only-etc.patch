Description: Fix timezone setting on read-only etc
 Due to our read-only /etc workaround, the localtime link on such
 system ends up in /etc/writable, not /etc. To make the link target
 correct in both normal and such systems, makes the path absolute.
 .
 On Ubuntu Core, this eliminates the need for the wrapper script, and
 makes the DBus interface work properly.
