Subject: Bump the self-test timeouts to increase autopkgtest success rate

Especially on i386 tests the systemd selftests were flaky for quite a while.
It turned out that 5/8 tests checked seemed to have worked fine but were
killed early by the timeouts expiring.
It was brought up that spectre and L1TF mitigations might have further
opened the window for these issues to trigger more often now.
Lets in our package bump the timeout which will worst case make a real bad test
slightly longer but probably safes many hours of wasted tests especially
considering how often they are jsut retried these days.
.
We might forward that upstream if for a while this proves to increase
the success rate of systemd autopkgtests.
Forwarded: no
Forward-info: need to prove with test success rate
