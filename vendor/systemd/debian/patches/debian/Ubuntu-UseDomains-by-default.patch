Subject: Set UseDomains to true, by default, on Ubuntu.

On Ubuntu, fallback DNS servers are disabled, therefore we do not leak queries
to a preset 3rd party by default. In resolved, dnssec is also disabled by
default, as too much of the internet is broken and using Ubuntu users to debug
the internet is not very productive - most of the time the end-user cannot fix
or know how to notify the site owners about the dnssec mistakes. Inherintally
the DHCP acquired DNS servers are therefore trusted, and are free to spoof
records. Not trusting DNS search domains, in such scenario, provides limited
security or privacy benefits. From user point of view, this also appears to be
a regression from previous Ubuntu releases which do trust DHCP acquired search
domains by default.

Therefore we are enabling UseDomains by default on Ubuntu.

Users may override this setting in the .network files by specifying
[DHCP|IPv6AcceptRA] UseDomains=no|route options.
