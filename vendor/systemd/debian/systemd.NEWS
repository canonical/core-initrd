systemd (251.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  systemd-resolved has been split into a separate package.
  This new systemd-resolved package will not be installed automatically on
  upgrades. If you are using systemd-resolved, please install this new
  package manually.

systemd (251.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  systemd-boot has been split into a separate package.
  This new systemd-boot package will not be installed automatically on
  upgrades. If you are using systemd-boot, please install this new
  package manually.

  The default boot loader in Debian is grub2. If you have not set up
  systemd-boot manually, no action is required on your side.

systemd (251.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  systemd-journal-gatewayd and systemd-journal-remote are now built
  without the --trust option, in order to be able to switch away from
  gnutls to openssl.

systemd (247.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  systemd now defaults to the "unified" cgroup hierarchy (i.e. cgroupv2).
  This change reflects the fact that cgroupsv2 support has matured
  substantially in both systemd and in the kernel.
  All major container tools nowadays should support cgroupv2.
  If you run into problems with cgroupv2, you can switch back to the previous,
  hybrid setup by adding "systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=false" to the
  kernel command line.
  You can read more about the benefits of cgroupv2 at
  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html

systemd (247.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  KERNEL API INCOMPATIBILITY: Linux 4.14 introduced two new uevents
  "bind" and "unbind" to the Linux device model. When this kernel
  change was made, systemd-udevd was only minimally updated to handle
  and propagate these new event types. The introduction of these new
  uevents (which are typically generated for USB devices and devices
  needing a firmware upload before being functional) resulted in a
  number of issues which we so far didn't address. We hoped the kernel
  maintainers would themselves address these issues in some form, but
  that did not happen. To handle them properly, many (if not most) udev
  rules files shipped in various packages need updating, and so do many
  programs that monitor or enumerate devices with libudev or sd-device,
  or otherwise process uevents. Please note that this incompatibility
  is not fault of systemd or udev, but caused by an incompatible kernel
  change that happened back in Linux 4.14, but is becoming more and
  more visible as the new uevents are generated by more kernel drivers.

  To learn more about the required udev rules changes please check the
  "CHANGES WITH 247" section of /usr/share/doc/systemd/NEWS.gz.

systemd (241-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  DRM render nodes (/dev/dri/renderD*) are now owned by group "render"
  (previously group "video"). Dynamic ACLs via the "uaccess" udev tag are still
  applied, so in the common case things should just continue to work.
  If you rely on static permissions to access those devices, you need to update
  group memberships accordingly to use group "render" now.

systemd (236-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  DynamicUser=yes has been enabled for systemd-journal-upload.service and
  systemd-journal-gatewayd.service.
  This means we no longer need to statically allocate a systemd-journal-upload
  and systemd-journal-gateway user and you can now safely remove those system
  users along with their associated groups.

systemd (231-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version drops support for running /etc/rcS.d SysV init scripts.
  These are prone to cause dependency loops, and almost all Debian packages
  with rcS scripts now ship a native systemd service. If you have custom or
  third-party rcS scripts you need to convert them or change them to run
  in rc2.d/ - rc5.d/; see this page for details:
  <https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/pkg-systemd/rcSMigration>.

systemd (224-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version splits out systemd-nspawn, systemd-machined, and machinectl
  into the new "systemd-container" package. That now also enables
  systemd-importd.

systemd (220-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  The mechanism for providing stable network interface names changed.
  Previously they were kept in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
  which mapped device MAC addresses to the (arbitrary) name they got when
  they first appeared (i. e. mostly at the time of installation). As this
  had several problems and is not supported any more, this is deprecated in
  favor of the "net.ifnames" mechanism. With this most of your network
  interfaces will get location-based names. If you have ifupdown, firewall,
  or other configuration that relies on the old names, you need to update
  these by Debian 10/Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and then remove
  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. Please see
  /usr/share/doc/udev/README.Debian.gz for details about this.
