# Reporting of Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, we'd appreciate a non-public disclosure. systemd developers can be contacted privately on the **[systemd-security@redhat.com](mailto:systemd-security@redhat.com) mailing list**. The disclosure will be coordinated with distributions.

(The [issue tracker](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues) and [systemd-devel mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel) are fully public.)

Subscription to the systemd-security mailing list is open to **regular systemd contributors and people working in the security teams of various distributions**. Those conditions should be backed by publicly accessible information (ideally, a track of posts and commits from the mail address in question). If you fall into one of those categories and wish to be subscribed, submit a **[subscription request](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/systemd-security)**.
