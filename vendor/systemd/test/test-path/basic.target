# We support /var, /tmp, /var/tmp, being on NFS, but we don't pull in
# remote-fs.target by default, hence pull them in explicitly here. Note that we
# require /var and /var/tmp, but only add a Wants= type dependency on /tmp, as
# we support that unit being masked, and this should not be considered an error.
